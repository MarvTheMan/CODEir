# CODE Search Engine

This is a text-based search engine written in Python for the course Computational Thinking.

**Usage:**
1. Make sure you have the dependencies installed (requirements.txt is provided). Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `conda install --file requirements.txt`.
2. Run `python download.py`. The lemmatizer from NLTK can not be installed through pip, but this file takes care of it.
3. Run `python main.py`. This will start the CODE Search Engine.
