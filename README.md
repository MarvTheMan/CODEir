# CODE Search Engine

This is a text-based search engine written in Python for the course Computational Thinking.

**Usage:**
1. Make sure you have the dependencies installed (requirements.txt is provided).
2. Run download.py. The lemmatizer from NLTK can not be installed through pip, but this file takes care of it.
3. Run main.py. This will start the CODE Search Engine.
