Smarter testing, faster vaccinations and health equity are cornerstones of the 200-page COVID-19 strategy released by US President Joe Bidenâ€™s administration this week. It also calls for a better online dashboard for tracking the prevalence of the virus in cities and towns across the United States, so that people and officials can make evidence-based decisions. Scientists lauded the coordinated national pandemic strategy and applauded the central role of science in the plan. Some experts have called for more detail, particularly on the funding, staffing and procedures for some initiatives, such as the plan for scaling up surveillance of new virus variants. All agree that it will be a tough task to turn things around in the hard-hit country, which has suffered more than 420,000 deaths due to the coronavirus.
